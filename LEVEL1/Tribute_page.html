        <p>
            <br>
            <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj </b>was the founder of the Maratha Empire in western India. He is considered
            to be one of the greatest warriors of his time and even today, stories of his exploits are narrated as a
            part of the folklore. With his valor and great administrative
            skills, Shivaji Maharaj carved out an enclave from the
            declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur. It eventually
            became the genesis of the Maratha Empire.
            After establishing his rule, Shivaji Maharaj implemented
            a competent and progressive administration with the help
            of a disciplined military and well-established administrative
            set-up. Shivaji Maharaj is well-known for his innovative
            military tactics that centered around non-conventional
            methods leveraging strategic factors like geography, speed,
            and surprise to defeat his more powerful enemies.
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Shivaji Maharaj was born in the Bhonsle Maratha clan to Shahaji and Jijabai on February 19, 1630, in
                present-day
                Maharashtra. His father was
                a Maratha general who served the Deccan Sultanates.</li>
            <li>As per several beliefs and accounts, Shivaji Maharaj was named after Lord Shiva. However, scholars
                suggest that
                it was Shivai,
                a local diety after whom he was named.</li>
            <li>Shivaji Maharaj was formally crowned as the Chhatrapati (emperor) of his realm at Raigad in 1674.</li>
            <li>He was a skilled commander and valiant warrior. He was extremely skilled at guerrilla-style warfare and
                planned stealthy war operations. He was often referred
                to as the ‘mountain rat’ for his art of stealthy warfare.
            </li>
            <li>Although, he was a keen learner with deep knowledge of religious texts including Ramayana and
                Mahabharata, he didn’t
                have any formal schooling.</li>
            <li>He is also known for reviving the Hindu political and courtly traditions. He promoted the usage of
                Marathi and Sanskrit language in administrative processes instead
                of the widely used language Persian.
            </li>
            <li>He set up the council of eight ministers or Ashta Pradhan Mandal, an administrative and advisory council
                that advised Shivaji Maharaj on
                various political and administrative matters.</li>
            <li>
                He was the first indigenous ruler of medieval India to build his own naval force and led his first
                full-fledged naval expedition in 1665.
            </li>
            <li>
                He was a secular king and had many Muslims in his army and office such as Ibrahim Khan and Daulat Khan
                who were prominent in the navy and Siddi Ibrahim the chief of artillery.
            </li>
            <li>Shivaji Maharaj fell ill with fever and dysentery in 1680 and passed away on 3rd April at the age of 52.

            <b>1. Conquest of Torana:</b><br>
            It was the first fort captured by Shivaji
            as Chieftain of Marathas which led to the foundation of his ruling
            attributes of valour and determination at the age of 16. This conquest
            drives him to capture another like Raigarh and Pratapgarh. Due to these conquests,
            the Sultan of Bijapur was getting panic and he put Shahji, Shivaji's father in prison.
            In AD 1659, Shivaji again tried to attack Bijapur then the Sultan of Bijapur sent his
            general, Afzal Khan, to capture Shivaji. But Shivaji managed to escape and killed him with
            a deadly weapon called Baghnakh or the tiger's claw. Finally, in 1662, the Sultan of
            Bijapur made a peace treaty with Shivaji
            and made him an independent ruler of his conquered territories.<br>
            <b>2. Conquest of Kondana fort:</b><br>
            It was under the control of
            Nilkanth Rao. It was fought between Tanaji Malusare, a commander of Maratha ruler
            Shivaji Maharaj and Udaybhan Rathod, fort keeper under Jai Singh I.

            <br><b>3. Alliance with Qutub Shahi rulers Golconda:</b><br> With the help of this alliance, he led the
            campaign into Bijapur
            Karanataka (AD 1676-79) and conquered
            Gingee (Jingi), Vellore and many forts in Karnataka.<br>
            <b>4. Coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj: </b><br>
            In AD 1674, Shivaji declared himself as an independent ruler of
            the Maratha Kingdom and was crowned as Chhatrapati at Raigarh. His coronation symbolises the rise
            of people who challenges the legacy of the Mughal’s. After the coronation, he gets the title of ‘Haidava
            Dharmodharka’ (Protector of Hindu faith) of the newly formed state of Hindavi
            Swarajya. This coronation gives a legitimate right to collect land revenue and levy tax on the people.
